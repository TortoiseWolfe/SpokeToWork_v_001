SpokeToWork helps you stay organized with a simple system for tracking companies and applications - all kept private and secure on your own account.\n\n## What SpokeToWork Helps You Do\n\nSpokeToWork is designed for job seekers who want to:\n\n- **Keep track of companies** you're interested in working for\n- **Manage job applications** from \"Applied\" through interviews to offers\n- **Plan visits** to companies (great for delivery drivers, sales roles, or just dropping off resumes)\n- **Stay organized** with notes, contacts, and follow-up reminders\n- **Connect with others** through private, encrypted messaging\n\nLet's walk through setting up your account and tracking your first application.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Set Your Home Location\n\nBefore adding companies, head to the **Companies** page and set your **Home Location**. This lets SpokeToWork calculate distances and plan efficient routes to potential employers.\n\n![Setting your home location](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/home-location-settings.png)\n_Enter your address and click Geocode to set your starting point_\n\nFor this walkthrough, we're starting from **Community Kitchen** (727 E 11th St, Chattanooga, TN 37403) - a real resource in downtown Chattanooga that helps folks getting back on their feet.\n\nSetting your home location first means every company you add will automatically show you how far away it is - helpful when you're planning visits by bike or on foot.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Add Your First Company\n\nHead to the **Companies** page. This is where you'll build your list of potential employers.\n\n### Adding the Chattanooga Public Library\n\nClick **Add Company** to open the form. Let's add a real location:\n\n![Adding a company to your list](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/add-company-form.png)\n_The company form lets you capture all the details you need_\n\nFill in the basics:\n\n- **Company Name**: Chattanooga Public Library\n- **Address**: 1001 Broad St, Chattanooga, TN 37402\n- **Website**: https://chattlibrary.org\n- **Phone**: (423) 757-5310\n\n### Adding Contact Information\n\nThe best job searches involve real connections. Add your contact at the company:\n\n- **Contact Name**: Human Resources\n- **Contact Title**: HR Department\n- **Email**: jobs@chattlibrary.org\n\n### Setting Status and Priority\n\nUse status to track where you are with each company:\n\n- **Not Contacted** - Companies you're researching\n- **Contacted** - You've reached out\n- **Follow Up** - Need to check back\n- **Meeting Scheduled** - Interview scheduled\n- **Positive Outcome** - Got the job!\n- **Negative Outcome** - Didn't work out (but you learned something)\n\nSet **Priority** (1-5) to focus on your top picks first.\n\n### Notes for Future You\n\nUse the **Notes** field for anything helpful:\n\n> \"Saw job posting for Library Assistant position. Hours are flexible, good for someone rebuilding. Apply online or in person.\"\n\nClick **Save** and your company is tracked!\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: View Your Companies\n\n![The companies list showing your tracked locations](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/companies-list.png)\n_Your company list shows status, priority, and latest application at a glance_\n\nYour companies page shows:\n\n- Company name and location\n- Current status (color-coded for quick scanning)\n- Priority level\n- Most recent application status\n- Quick actions to edit, view details, or delete\n\nClick any company to see the full details drawer with all your notes, contacts, and applications.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Track a Job Application\n\nFound a job posting? Let's track it!\n\n### Adding an Application\n\nClick on the Chattanooga Public Library to open the details drawer, then click the **Add** button next to the Applications header (or **Add your first application** if you haven't added any yet).\n\n![Adding a job application](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/add-application.png)\n_Track each application with position details and dates_\n\nFill in:\n\n- **Position Title**: Library Assistant\n- **Date Applied**: December 14, 2025\n- **Status**: Applied\n\n### Application Statuses\n\nSpokeToWork tracks your application through each stage:\n\n- **Not Applied** - You're interested but haven't applied yet\n- **Applied** - Application submitted\n- **Screening** - Initial review, phone screen\n- **Interviewing** - In-person or video interviews\n- **Offer** - They made you an offer!\n- **Closed** - Position filled or you moved on\n\n### Tracking Outcomes\n\nWhen an application concludes, record the outcome:\n\n- **Pending** - Still in progress\n- **Hired** - You got the job!\n- **Rejected** - They said no (it happens)\n- **Withdrawn** - You decided to pass\n- **Ghosted** - Never heard back (unfortunately common)\n\nThis data helps you understand your job search patterns over time.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Plan Your Visits with Routes\n\nFor job hunters who want to visit companies in person - whether to drop off a resume, scope out the location, or attend an interview - SpokeToWork includes bicycle route planning.\n\n![Route planning sidebar showing companies to visit](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/route-sidebar.png)\n_Plan your route and mark which companies to visit on your next trip_\n\n### Creating a Route\n\n1. Click the **New** button in the Routes sidebar\n2. Name it (e.g., \"Downtown Chattanooga - Week 1\")\n3. Add companies from your list to the route\n4. Drag to reorder your stops\n\nFor example, a route from Community Kitchen to the library, then to other downtown locations like the Chattanooga Convention Center or City Hall - all within biking distance.\n\n### The \"Next Ride\" Feature\n\nMark companies with **Next** to highlight which ones you'll visit on your next trip. This keeps your route focused when you have many companies saved.\n\n### View on the Map\n\nNavigate to the **Map** page from the main navigation to see all your companies plotted on an interactive map. The route line shows the suggested path between stops.\n\n![Interactive map showing company locations](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/map-view.png)\n_See your companies on a map with the planned route_\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Privacy and Security\n\nYour job search is personal. Here's how SpokeToWork handles your data:\n\n- **Your Data, Your Account**: Companies and applications are private to your account - only you can see them\n- **Encrypted Messaging**: If you connect with other job seekers, messages are end-to-end encrypted. We literally cannot read them, even if we wanted to\n- **Anonymous Analytics**: We use Google Analytics to understand how people use the app (which pages are popular, where users get stuck). This data is anonymous - we see trends, not individuals. We never sell this data.\n- **No Data Selling**: We don't sell your personal information to advertisers or third parties\n\nLearn more about our encryption in our [security explainer](/blog/message-encryption-security-explained).\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference: Job Application Workflow\n\nHere's a typical workflow for tracking a job opportunity:\n\n1. **Set up**: Configure your home location in your profile\n2. **Research**: Find a company you like, add it to SpokeToWork with status \"Not Contacted\"\n3. **Reach Out**: Apply for a position, update status to \"Contacted\", add an application with \"Applied\"\n4. **Follow Up**: Set a follow-up date, add notes about any conversations\n5. **Interview**: Update application status to \"Interviewing\", add interview date\n6. **Result**: Record the outcome - celebrate if hired, learn if not\n\n---\n\n## Tips for Job Search Success\n\n### Keep Notes Updated\n\nFuture you will thank present you for detailed notes. Write down:\n\n- Who you talked to and when\n- What they said about the role\n- Any requirements or next steps mentioned\n\n### Use Priority Wisely\n\nNot all opportunities are equal. Rank your dream jobs higher so you focus energy where it matters most.\n\n### Check In Weekly\n\nSet aside time each week to:\n\n- Review your application statuses\n- Update any companies where things have changed\n- Add new companies you've discovered\n\n### Don't Take Ghosting Personally\n\nIf a company never responds, mark it and move on. The outcome tracking helps you see patterns - some industries are worse about this than others.\n\n---\n\n## What's Next?\n\nYou're ready to start organizing your job search! Here's what to do:\n\n1. **Sign up** or log in to your account\n2. **Set your home location** in your profile\n3. **Add 3-5 companies** you're interested in\n4. **Track at least one application** to see how it works\n5. **Explore the map** if you plan to visit any locations\n\nGood luck with your job search! SpokeToWork is here to help you stay organized and focused on what matters: finding the right opportunity.\n\n---\n\n_Have questions?
