      "content": "\n# LinkedIn: Stay Visible with Networking & Posts\n\n*Part 4 of 4 in the LinkedIn Optimization Series*\n\n**Series:** [Part 1: Get Found](/blog/linkedin-optimization-get-found) | [Part 2: Tell Your Story](/blog/linkedin-optimization-tell-your-story) | [Part 3: Build Proof](/blog/linkedin-optimization-build-proof) | [Part 4: Stay Visible]\n\n---\n\nYou've optimized your profile for search. You've crafted a compelling story. You've backed it up with skills and recommendations. Now comes the part most people skip: staying visible.\n\nA perfect profile that sits dormant is like a storefront with the lights off. LinkedIn rewards activity. The more you engage, the more you appear in searches and feeds. And the more visible you are, the more opportunities find you.\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: **70-85% of roles are filled through networking.** Many positions are never posted publicly—they're shared through internal referrals and recommendations. A referral can move your application from a pile of 500 to the top 10 considered in under 24 hours.\n\nThis isn't about being pushy. It's about being present.\n\n---\n\n## The PEAR Framework: Who to Connect With\n\nWhen building your network, think **PEAR**:\n\n| Letter | Category | Examples |\n|--------|----------|----------|\n| **P** | Peers | Developers a step ahead of you, people at target companies |\n| **E** | Employers | Hiring managers, recruiters at companies you're interested in |\n| **A** | Alumni | Boot camp graduates, university alumni, former colleagues |\n| **R** | Relevant Communities | Meetup organizers, Discord/Slack members, open source contributors |\n\nYou don't have to know these people personally. Shared context—like attending the same program or working in the same industry—builds trust fast.\n\n---\n\n## The Personalization Formula\n\nGeneric connection requests get ignored. Personalized ones get accepted.\n\n**Formula: Context + Relevance + Small Ask**\n\n### Example\n\n> \"Hi Kai, fellow TechJoy alum here. Saw your work on [specific project]. Would love to connect and follow your updates.\"\n\n### Why It Works\n\n- Shows you're not mass-messaging\n- Creates immediate common ground\n- Makes it easy to say yes\n\n### What to Avoid\n\n- Generic messages: \"I'd like to add you to my professional network\"\n- Asking for referrals before building rapport\n- Walls of text\n\nKeep it to 2-3 sentences. Make the ask small (\"would love to connect\" vs. \"can you refer me?\").\n\n---\n\n## Nurturing Relationships: The Long Game\n\nThe strongest networks come from relationships that feel natural, human, and mutually supportive. Think of it like watering a plant—small check-ins keep the connection alive.\n\n### Four Principles\n\n1. **Consistency** - Small touchpoints every few months\n2. **Curiosity** - Ask about their work, not just what you need\n3. **Gratitude** - A simple thank-you goes far\n4. **Value sharing** - Share something useful without expecting anything back\n\n### Check-In Templates (Non-Transactional)\n\n**Context-based:**\n> \"Hi Jordan, I just saw an article about UX design trends and it reminded me of the conversation we had. How have things been on your end?\"\n\n**Curiosity-driven:**\n> \"Hi Sam, I remember you mentioned starting a new role around the time we last spoke. How has that transition been?\"\n\n**After a milestone:**\n> \"Hey Chris, congrats on your 2-year anniversary at Company X. How has your role grown since you started?\"\n\n**After they posted something:**\n> \"Hi Taylor, I really enjoyed that post on AI trends. What's been the most surprising change you've seen so far?\"\n\n### What to Avoid\n\n- \"Hi, I'm job hunting and wondered if you'd know of any openings.\"\n- \"Hey, we haven't talked in a while. Can you refer me?\"\n- \"Do you have 15 minutes for a call?\" (without context)\n\nBuild rapport before making requests.\n\n---\n\n## The Coffee Chat Approach\n\nReaching out to people at target companies for virtual coffee chats has proven highly effective.\n\n### What Happens\n\n- Some people accept and have great conversations\n- Some can't meet but offer to answer questions via message\n- Some don't respond (that's okay)\n\n### Questions to Ask\n\n- What do you enjoy most about working there?\n- What skills matter most for roles like this?\n- How has your role evolved since you started?\n- What surprised you about the company or industry?\n\n### After the Chat\n\nKeep in touch. Congratulate them on milestones. Check in when they change jobs. The people who helped you once are likely to help again.\n\n---\n\n## Messaging & Cold Outreach\n\nIn 2025, short beats long. Hiring managers and recruiters skim messages on their phones between meetings. Your message needs to be readable in 15-20 seconds.\n\n### The 3-1-1 Formula\n\n- **3 words of context** (\"Fellow TechJoy alum\", \"Saw your talk\")\n- **1 line** specific about them\n- **1 micro ask**\n\n### The TACO Close\n\n**T**iny **A**sk, **C**lear **O**utcome\n\n- \"Could you share one suggestion on...?\"\n- \"Is it worth applying for X, or is Y a better fit?\"\n- \"If there's a better contact, happy to reach out.\"\n\n### Example Messages\n\n**To an alum:**\n> \"Hello, fellow TechJoy alum here. I saw your post about onboarding developers. One quick question: if you had to pick between Spring Boot and Flask for AI-focused projects, which would you suggest?\"\n\n**To a hiring manager (after applying):**\n> \"Hi Priya, I applied to the full-stack role on Monday. Two strengths I'd bring: designing REST APIs and building low-code solutions. Would a quick note on your top success criteria help me tailor my examples?\"\n\n**To a recruiter:**\n> \"Hi Taylor, I'm a full-stack developer with Python, React, and low-code experience. Based in [city], open to hybrid or remote. If you're open, is there one opportunity I should have on my radar this week?\"\n\n### Follow-Up Sequence\n\n| Day | Action |\n|-----|--------|\n| Day 1 | Initial connection note |\n| Day 3 | First follow-up (\"Bumping this in case it was buried...\") |\n| Day 7 | Value-add note (share a relevant article) |\n| Day 14 | Graceful close (\"Closing the loop so I don't crowd your inbox...\") |\n\n---\n\n## Posting: Show Your Work\n\nPosting makes you visible to people beyond your immediate network. Recruiters often find candidates through their posts and comments.\n\n### Frequency\n\n**2-3 times per week** is the sweet spot—visible without oversharing.\n\n### Post Types That Work\n\n**Learning journey posts:**\n> What you're coding, building, or struggling with\n\n**Project work with insight:**\n> Not just \"I made this\" but \"Here's what I made and why it matters\"\n\n**Industry commentary:**\n> Your reaction to AI trends, tech news, hiring changes\n\n**Gratitude posts:**\n> Shout out to mentors, teammates, or people who helped\n\n### Post Structure\n\n1. **Hook line** - Draws people in (only a preview shows before \"see more\")\n2. **Body (3-5 sentences)** - What you're working on, why it matters, what you learned\n3. **Call to action** - Ask a question, invite comments, share gratitude\n\n### Example Post\n\n> \"This week I built my first full-stack project at TechJoy Academy. It challenged me to think about user flows and debugging in new ways. I learned that breaking problems into smaller parts makes solutions faster and cleaner. Curious how others approach debugging when they're stuck on code.\"\n\n---\n\n## Commenting: Add Value Every Time\n\nComments put you directly on recruiters' and hiring managers' radar. They care about what you think.\n\n### Don't Write\n\n> \"Great post!\"\n\n### Do Write\n\n> \"This is spot on. I've been applying this in my projects by [specific example].\"\n\n### Strong Comment Starters\n\n- \"This aligns with what I've been seeing in my projects.\"\n- \"I agree with your point on [X]. In my experience, [Y] has also been important.\"\n- \"Thanks for sharing. I've been exploring similar approaches in my coding journey.\"\n\n### The Comment → DM Strategy\n\n1. Comment on someone's post\n2. Follow up with a DM referencing your comment\n3. The DM feels warmer because you've already engaged\n\n---\n\n## Hashtag Strategy\n\nHashtags categorize your posts, expand visibility, and signal keywords to recruiters.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- Use **3-5 hashtags max**\n- Mix broad and niche tags\n- Check activity before using (inactive hashtags won't help)\n\n### Example Hashtags\n\n- #FullStackDeveloper\n- #OpenToWork\n- #React\n- #AI\n- #CareerGrowth\n- #TechHiring\n- #WomenWhoCode\n\n---\n\n## Following Companies\n\nWhen you **follow a company**, your interest shows up in recruiter searches. This signals that you're interested in their organization—even before you apply.\n\nFollow:\n- Target companies you want to work for\n- Companies where people in your network work\n- Companies posting about topics you care about\n\n---\n\n## Time Investment\n\n**10-15 minutes a day** is enough to stay visible.\n\n- Scroll your feed\n- Comment on 1-2 posts\n- Post 2-3 times per week\n- Send a few connection requests\n\nConsistency beats intensity. Small actions compound over time.\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **70-85% of roles** are filled through networking\n2. **PEAR framework** - Connect with Peers, Employers, Alumni, Relevant communities\n3. **Personalization formula** - Context + Relevance + Small Ask\n4. **Nurture relationships** - Consistency, curiosity, gratitude, value sharing\n5. **Coffee chats work** - Ask questions, follow up, stay in touch\n6. **Short messages win** - 3-1-1 formula, TACO close, 15-20 seconds to read\n7. **Post 2-3 times weekly** - Learning journey, projects, industry commentary\n8. **Add value in comments** - No \"great post\"\n9. **Use 3-5 hashtags** - Mix broad and niche\n10. **Follow target companies** - Signals interest to recruiters\n11. **10-15 minutes daily** - Consistency > perfection\n\n---\n\n## Your Action Items\n\n1. Identify 5 people using the PEAR framework to connect with this week\n2. Send personalized connection requests (Context + Relevance + Small Ask)\n3. Send one genuine check-in to an existing connection\n4. Comment on 2 posts in your feed this week (add value, not just \"great post\")\n5. Write your first post—or your next one\n6. Follow 3 target companies\n7. Set a daily reminder: 10-15 minutes of LinkedIn engagement\n\n---\n\n*This series is based on career coaching from [Chelsea Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chelseascott/), adapted for SpokeToWork.com.*\n\n**Previous:** [Part 3: Build Proof—Skills, Projects & Recommendations](/blog/linkedin-optimization-build-proof)\n\n---\n\n## Series Complete\n\nYou've now covered the complete LinkedIn optimization playbook:\n\n1. **[Get Found](/blog/linkedin-optimization-get-found)** - How recruiters search and how to show up\n2. **[Tell Your Story](/blog/linkedin-optimization-tell-your-story)** - Headline, About, and Experience that connect\n3. **[Build Proof](/blog/linkedin-optimization-build-proof)** - Skills, projects, and recommendations that validate\n4. **Stay Visible** - Networking and engagement that keep you top of mind\n\nYour LinkedIn profile is never done.

      "content": "\n# LinkedIn: Build Proof with Skills & Projects\n\n*Part 3 of 4 in the LinkedIn Optimization Series*\n\n**Series:** [Part 1: Get Found](/blog/linkedin-optimization-get-found) | [Part 2: Tell Your Story](/blog/linkedin-optimization-tell-your-story) | [Part 3: Build Proof] | [Part 4: Stay Visible](/blog/linkedin-optimization-stay-visible)\n\n---\n\nYou've optimized for search. You've crafted a compelling headline and About section. Now it's time to back it up.\n\nClaims without proof are just words. Recruiters and hiring managers want validation—evidence that you can actually do what you say you can do. That's where your Skills section, Projects, and Recommendations come in.\n\nThese are your credibility markers. They transform your profile from a self-description into a verified portfolio.\n\n---\n\n## The Skills Section: Your Searchable Inventory\n\nLinkedIn allows you to list up to 50 skills. ATS systems and LinkedIn Recruiter heavily rely on this section to filter candidates.\n\n### Why Skills Matter for Search\n\nWhen recruiters build searches, they filter by skills. If a recruiter searches for \"React AND PostgreSQL\" and those skills aren't in your profile, you won't appear—even if you mention them elsewhere in your text.\n\nA lean skills section (only a few skills listed) signals either limited experience or someone who hasn't maintained their profile. Neither is a good look.\n\n### How Many Skills to Add\n\n- **Minimum:** 30 skills\n- **Maximum:** 50 skills (LinkedIn's limit)\n- **Per job:** 3-5 skills attached to each position\n\n### What to Include\n\n**Hard Skills (get you the interview):**\n- Programming languages (JavaScript, Python, TypeScript)\n- Frameworks and libraries (React, Node.js, Next.js)\n- Tools (Git, GitHub, VS Code, Postman, Figma)\n- Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL)\n- Methodologies (Agile, CI/CD, TDD)\n\n**Soft Skills (help you pass the interview and keep the job):**\n- Problem solving\n- Communication\n- Collaboration\n- Mentorship\n- Time management\n- Adaptability\n\nTech is a team sport. Hard skills show what you can build. Soft skills are your reputation—how you use your tools and work with others.\n\n### Mentorship as a Skill\n\nIf you've mentored anyone—peers, junior team members, bootcamp classmates—add \"Mentorship\" as a skill. This signals leadership potential. Many organizations assign mentors to new hires, and they look for this capability.\n\n### Skills Placement Strategy\n\n1. **Top 3 skills** - Your most important, recruiter-searched skills\n2. **Skills per job** - Add relevant skills to each position in your Experience section\n3. **Endorsements** - Ask connections to endorse your key skills (this boosts credibility)\n\n---\n\n## Projects: Proof You've Built Real Things\n\nProjects demonstrate that you've worked on real products with real teams—not just attended classes. For boot camp graduates and career changers, projects are especially critical.\n\n### The Project Framework\n\n**What it is + What tools you used + What you built + Impact/Result**\n\n### Example With Metrics\n\n> \"Built a full-stack budgeting app using React, Node.js, and MongoDB that allowed users to track expenses. Designed UI for intuitive UX, deployed with Netlify. Reduced friction for new users by 25% in testing.\"\n\n### Example Without Metrics\n\n> \"Collaborated with a team to build a task manager in four days. Delivered 100% complete and usable product by strict deadline following SLICK methodology (Simple, Lovable, Complete).\"\n\n### When to Include Metrics\n\nOnly include metrics if you can speak to them in detail during an interview. If you can't quantify the impact, focus on:\n- What you built\n- What technologies you used\n- That you delivered a complete, working product\n\n### Important Notes on Sharing Work\n\n- **Always ask permission** before posting client work (some projects have NDAs)\n- **Only post live, working links** - never broken links\n- **Use password protection** for sensitive work samples\n- **Tag collaborators** and give credit to team members\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations: Social Proof That Lives on Your Profile\n\nRecommendations are mini-references that validate what you've said about yourself. They demonstrate credibility and build trust.\n\n### Why Recommendations Matter\n\n- **Hiring managers** scan recommendations before or after interviews to confirm impressions\n- **Recruiters** use them as tie-breakers between equally strong candidates\n- **Keywords in recommendations count** toward your profile's searchability\n\nRecommendations are especially valuable for:\n- **Career changers** - They highlight transferable skills and professionalism\n- **Early-career professionals** - They show real-world collaboration abilities\n\n### Types of Recommendations\n\nThink broadly about who can vouch for you:\n\n| Type | Who | What They Highlight |\n|------|-----|---------------------|\n| **Peer** | Classmates, teammates, colleagues | Collaboration, teamwork |\n| **Manager/Supervisor** | Bosses, team leads | Accountability, quality of work |\n| **Mentor/Coach** | Teachers, advisors | Growth, learning, character |\n| **Client** | Customers, stakeholders | Reliability, outcomes |\n\n### When to Ask (Timing Matters)\n\n- Right after completing a project or assignment\n- After receiving positive feedback\n- When wrapping up an internship, boot camp, or position\n\nPeople's memory is fresh and they're more inclined to write something meaningful.\n\n### How to Ask: The Warm Approach\n\nDon't just use LinkedIn's generic request tool. Reach out personally first:\n\n**Template:**\n> \"Hi [Name], I valued working with you on [project/context]. I'm working on strengthening my LinkedIn presence and would love if you'd feel comfortable writing a short recommendation. It would be especially helpful if you could highlight [specific skill, quality, or project impact]. Thank you so much for considering.\"\n\n**What to avoid:**\n- Applying pressure (\"I need this for my job search\")\n- Being vague (\"Can you just write me one?\")\n- Mass-sending the same generic request\n\n---\n\n## How to Write Strong Recommendations\n\nIt's not just about asking—it's about reciprocating. When someone recommends you, offer to write one in return.\n\n### The 4-Part Framework\n\n1. **Context** - How you know the person\n2. **Skills and Qualities** - What they demonstrated\n3. **Impact** - The difference they made\n4. **Closing Endorsement** - Your recommendation\n\n### Example Using the Framework\n\n> \"I worked alongside Katrina in the Joy of Coding program where we collaborated on building a Python-based inventory system. **(Context)**\n>\n> Katrina consistently showed strong problem-solving skills and an eagerness to support teammates by explaining complex logic clearly. **(Skills)**\n>\n> Her contributions improved our app's efficiency and helped the team stay motivated during crunch times. **(Impact)**\n>\n> I would highly recommend Katrina for any software development role. She's reliable, collaborative, and technically sharp.\" **(Endorsement)**\n\n### Weak vs Strong Recommendations\n\n**Weak:**\n> \"She was nice to work with. A hard worker.\"\n\n*Problem: Vague, no proof of specific skills*\n\n**Strong:**\n> \"I collaborated with Hope on a full-stack project where she led the React development. Her ability to debug complex UI issues saved us time and kept our launch on schedule. She communicates clearly, contributes ideas, and is the type of teammate every team wants.\"\n\n*Why it works: Specific, contextual, persuasive*\n\n### Length Guidelines\n\nKeep it concise: **3-5 sentences** is ideal. Shorter and specific beats long and generic.\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Add 30-50 skills** - LinkedIn's search relies on your Skills section\n2. **Attach skills to each job** - 3-5 skills per position\n3. **Include soft skills** - They matter for interviews and career growth\n4. **Add \"Mentorship\" if applicable** - It signals leadership potential\n5. **Projects prove you build things** - Use the What + Tools + Built + Impact framework\n6. **Only include metrics you can speak to** - Otherwise focus on delivery\n7. **Recommendations validate your claims** - They're mini-references on your profile\n8. **Ask when memory is fresh** - Right after projects, feedback, milestones\n9. **Use the 4-part framework** - Context → Skills → Impact → Endorsement\n10. **Reciprocate** - Offer to write recommendations for others\n\n---\n\n## Your Action Items\n\n1. Count your current skills - if under 30, add more relevant ones\n2. Add 3-5 skills to each job in your Experience section\n3. Add at least one project with a strong description\n4. Identify 2-3 people who could write recommendations (peer, mentor, manager)\n5. Send one personalized recommendation request this week\n6. Write one recommendation for someone else\n\n---\n\n*This series is based on career coaching from [Chelsea Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chelseascott/), adapted for SpokeToWork.com.*\n\n**Previous:** [Part 2: Tell Your Story—Headline, About & Experience That Connect](/blog/linkedin-optimization-tell-your-story)\n**Next in the series:** [Part 4: Stay Visible—Networking, Posting & Engagement](/blog/linkedin-optimization-stay-visible)\n\n---\n\n_Have questions?

      "content": "\n# LinkedIn: Craft Your Headline, About & Experience\n\n*Part 2 of 4 in the LinkedIn Optimization Series*\n\n**Series:** [Part 1: Get Found](/blog/linkedin-optimization-get-found) | [Part 2: Tell Your Story] | [Part 3: Build Proof](/blog/linkedin-optimization-build-proof) | [Part 4: Stay Visible](/blog/linkedin-optimization-stay-visible)\n\n---\n\nIn Part 1, we covered how recruiters search LinkedIn and why keywords matter. But showing up in search results is only half the battle. Once someone clicks on your profile, you have seconds to make an impression.\n\nThis is where storytelling comes in. Your LinkedIn profile isn't just a database entry—it's a narrative. It's the human side of your resume.\n\nUnlike a resume, which is limited to bullet points and rigid formatting, LinkedIn gives you space to explain the *why* behind the *what*. It lets you connect the dots between your background and your career goals—especially valuable if you're a career changer or early in your career.\n\n---\n\n## The 30-Second Test\n\nHere's an exercise: If someone only saw your LinkedIn profile for 30 seconds, what three things would you want them to walk away knowing about you?\n\nWrite those three things down. They become the framework for your headline and summary.\n\nThis simple exercise cuts through the noise and forces you to prioritize what actually matters.\n\n---\n\n## Profile Photo: Your First Impression\n\nYour photo and headline are the first things anyone sees. Before they read a single word about your experience, they've already formed an impression.\n\n### Photo Guidelines\n\n**Do:**\n- Clear headshot with good lighting\n- Professional but approachable expression\n- Plain or slightly blurred background\n- Tech-appropriate attire (casual but neat)\n- Smile or friendly neutral expression\n\n**Don't:**\n- Selfies or filtered photos\n- Group shots (including pets)\n- Low resolution or blurry images\n- Heavy editing or artificial backgrounds\n\n### Free Resources for Better Photos\n\n- **Phone portrait mode** - creates clean background blur\n- **Canva** - for cropping and basic editing\n- **YouTube tutorials** - photographers teaching lighting and angles\n- **AI photo platforms** - upload 6-8 photos for a professional composite\n- **Tech events and job fairs** - often have free headshot booths\n\n---\n\n## Banner Image: Don't Leave It Blank\n\nYour banner is the largest graphic on your profile. A blank banner signals an incomplete profile. Even a simple branded image shows intentionality.\n\n### Banner Ideas\n\n- Tech-themed banners (GitHub, coding imagery)\n- City skyline of where you live or want to work\n- Code snippets or IDE screenshots\n- Abstract tech or gradient backgrounds\n- Personal branding or inspirational quote\n- Canva templates (search \"LinkedIn banner\")\n\n---\n\n## The Headline Formula\n\nYour headline appears everywhere—search results, connection requests, comments, messages. It's often the *only* thing people see before deciding whether to click.\n\n### The Formula\n\n**Role/Identity + Skills & Tools + What You're Excited About**\n\nThe components can be in any order. The goal is to balance:\n- **Keywords** (for searchability)\n- **Personality** (to stand out)\n\n### Strong Headline Examples\n\n**Full Stack Developer:**\n- \"Full Stack Developer | React, Node.js, TypeScript | Building scalable user-centric web apps\"\n- \"Full Stack Developer | React, Node.js, MongoDB | Eager to build, learn, and ship real products\"\n\n**Career Transition:**\n- \"Full Stack Developer | Former Software Tester | Detail-oriented, adaptive, and driven to build\"\n- \"Developer in Training | From testing to building great products | Collaborative, quick to pivot, always learning\"\n\n**With Soft Skills:**\n- \"Full Stack Developer | React, Node.js | Turning ideas into scalable, user-first web apps\"\n- \"Technical Business Analyst | Data and Integration Expert | Bridging tech strategy and emerging innovation\"\n\n### What to Avoid\n\n- \"Aspiring developer looking for opportunities\" (too vague, \"looking for opportunities\" is assumed)\n- \"Recent boot camp grad\" (not ideal for headline)\n- Generic titles without specifics\n- Filler phrases that don't add value\n\n---\n\n## The About Section: Your Voice\n\nThe About section is one of the few narrative parts of LinkedIn. It's not a summary of your resume—it's a snapshot of who you are, why you made the leap into tech, what drives you, and where you're headed.\n\n### The 5-Part Structure\n\n1. **Clear, confident opening line** - Who you are + what you do + what you're working toward\n2. **A sense of who you are professionally** - Your background and how it connects to your current path\n3. **What you're working on now** - Current projects, skills you're developing, what excites you\n4. **Your personality and values** - A line about how you think, what drives you, why tech excites you\n5. **Call to action (optional)** - Open to networking, collaboration, or opportunities\n\n### Example: Career Changer (Architecture to Tech)\n\n> \"I'm a front-end developer with a background in architecture and a growing passion for building responsive, accessible web experiences. I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and recently completed a React-focused boot camp where I built a task manager app with real-time form validation.\n>\n> Before transitioning into tech, I managed cross-disciplinary design projects and collaborated with engineers, clients, and city agencies, which taught me how to communicate clearly and think in systems.\n>\n> I am currently diving deeper into TypeScript, accessibility best practices, and test-driven development. I love clean design, collaborative code, and solving the kind of problems that make life a little easier for users.\"\n\n### Example: Mid-Level Developer\n\n> \"I am a full stack developer with experience building internal tools and customer-facing platforms in startup environments. My background is in product design, so I bring a user-centered approach to everything I code.\n>\n> Whether I'm building APIs, shaping back-end architecture, or refactoring a messy UI, I've worked in small teams where adaptability and ownership matter. I'm especially comfortable collaborating with designers and project managers to turn ambiguous ideas into shipped features.\n>\n> Outside of work, I mentor early-career developers and occasionally write about web performance and component design.\"\n\n### Words to Avoid\n\nBased on conversations with recruiters and talent leaders, avoid these terms:\n\n- **\"Seasoned\"** - overused and vague\n- **\"Junior\"** - in your summary (list it in Experience if it's your actual title)\n- **\"Aspiring\"** - signals uncertainty\n- **Years of experience** (\"25+ years\") - let your timeline speak for itself\n\nWhy? Recruiters can determine your level from your profile. Keep that detail for phone screen conversations.\n\n### Writing Tips\n\n- **Use plain, confident language** - Write like a human, not a press release\n- **Avoid buzzwords** - \"Results-driven\" and \"team-oriented\" are overused\n- **Highlight what you build or solve** - Focus on outcomes, not just tasks\n- **Include a human touch** - What drives you? Why does tech excite you?\n\n---\n\n## Experience Section: Skills Over Duties\n\nHere's a critical shift for 2025: **Don't list duties in your experience section. List skills.**\n\nDuties are antiquated. Skills are what pull you into recruiter searches. LinkedIn's search engine picks from skills you've selected, not everything you've written.\n\n### The Shift\n\n**Old approach (duties):**\n> \"Responsible for maintaining company database and generating reports.\"\n\n**New approach (skills):**\n> \"PostgreSQL | Data Analysis | Report Automation | Built dashboards that reduced manual reporting time by 40%\"\n\n### Where Duties Belong\n\n- **Resume** - where bullet points and accomplishments live\n- **Interviews** - where you elaborate on your responsibilities\n- **Cover letters** - where you contextualize your experience\n\nYour LinkedIn experience section should be a skills showcase, not a job description.\n\n---\n\n## Showcasing Projects\n\nProjects are proof that you've built real things with real teams—not just attended classes.\n\n### Project Framework\n\n**What it is + What tools you used + What you built + Impact/Result**\n\n### Example With Metrics\n\n> \"Built a full-stack budgeting app using React, Node.js, and MongoDB that allowed users to track expenses. Designed UI for intuitive UX, deployed with Netlify. Reduced friction for new users by 25% in testing.\"\n\n### Example Without Metrics\n\n> \"Collaborated on a team to build a task manager in four days. Delivered 100% complete and usable product by strict deadline following SLICK methodology (Simple, Lovable, Complete).\"\n\nOnly include metrics if you can speak to them in detail. If you can't quantify the impact, focus on: what you built, what tools you used, and that you delivered.\n\n---\n\n## Education Section Format\n\nBoot camps and certification programs aren't just training—they're proof of commitment and skill development.\n\n### What to Include\n\n1. Name of the program\n2. Technologies learned\n3. Notable projects\n4. Certifications earned\n\n### Example Format\n\n```\nTechJoy Academy\nFull Stack Web Development Certificate Program\n[Start Date] - [End Date]\n\nTechnologies: React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, GitHub, CI/CD\n\nNotable Projects:\n• TaskFlow Pro - Built full-stack task manager using React, Node.js, MongoDB. Integrated real-time updates with Socket.io\n• Low Code CRM Tool - Collaborated on client-facing CRM built with Glide Apps\n\nCertifications: Certificate in Full Stack Web Development\n```\n\n---\n\n## Should You Include Non-Tech Jobs?\n\n**Yes.** Your journey matters.\n\nPrevious jobs show transferable skills—project management, communication, client relations, problem-solving. They demonstrate that you've worked, have life experience, and can function in professional environments.\n\nPost-COVID, varied career paths are much more accepted. Don't hide your history. Frame it as the foundation that led you here.\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **The 30-second test** - If someone saw your profile for 30 seconds, what 3 things should they know?\n2. **Photos matter** - Professional, clear, well-lit headshot with approachable expression\n3. **Don't leave the banner blank** - Even simple tech imagery shows intentionality\n4. **Headline formula** - Role + Skills + What excites you (balance keywords and personality)\n5. **About section structure** - Opening → Who you are → Current work → Values → CTA\n6. **Avoid trigger words** - \"Seasoned,\" \"junior,\" \"aspiring,\" years of experience\n7. **Skills over duties** - Your experience section should showcase searchable skills\n8. **Project framework** - What + Tools + Built + Impact\n9. **Include non-tech jobs** - They show transferable skills and your journey\n\n---\n\n## Your Action Items\n\n1. Take the 30-second test - write down 3 things you want people to know\n2. Check your photo against the guidelines - update if needed\n3. Add a banner image if yours is blank\n4. Rewrite your headline using the formula\n5. Restructure your About section using the 5-part framework\n6. Audit your Experience section - replace duties with skills\n7. Add at least one project with a strong description\n\n---\n\n*This series is based on career coaching from [Chelsea Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chelseascott/), adapted for SpokeToWork.com.*\n\n**Previous:** [Part 1: Get Found—How Recruiters Actually Search LinkedIn](/blog/linkedin-optimization-get-found)\n**Next in the series:** [Part 3: Build Proof—Skills, Projects & Recommendations](/blog/linkedin-optimization-build-proof)\n\n---\n\n_Have questions?

      "content": "\n# Get Found: How Recruiters Actually Search LinkedIn\n\n*Part 1 of 4 in the LinkedIn Optimization Series*\n\n**Series:** [Part 1: Get Found] | [Part 2: Tell Your Story](/blog/linkedin-optimization-tell-your-story) | [Part 3: Build Proof](/blog/linkedin-optimization-build-proof) | [Part 4: Stay Visible](/blog/linkedin-optimization-stay-visible)\n\n---\n\nYou could have the perfect background for a role and never get contacted. Not because you're unqualified—but because recruiters literally can't find you.\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: **95% of recruiters use LinkedIn daily to source talent**. And 90% of them rely on keyword filters to narrow down candidates. If your profile doesn't contain the exact words they're searching for, you're invisible.\n\nThe good news? Once you understand how recruiters search, you can optimize your profile to show up.\n\n---\n\n## How Recruiters Actually Find Candidates\n\nRecruiters don't browse LinkedIn hoping to stumble across great candidates. They search it—the same way you search Google.\n\nThey use a paid tool called **LinkedIn Recruiter** that lets them build complex searches using:\n\n- **Keywords** (job titles, skills, technologies)\n- **Location filters** (remote, hybrid, on-site)\n- **Experience level**\n- **Industry**\n\nHere's what a typical recruiter search string looks like:\n\n```\n(\"Full Stack Developer\" OR \"Software Engineer\") AND (React OR NodeJS OR JavaScript) AND (API OR PostgreSQL OR AWS)\n```\n\nThis tells LinkedIn: *\"Find me developers who know React, NodeJS, or JavaScript AND have experience with APIs, PostgreSQL, or AWS.\"*\n\nIf your profile doesn't contain those exact terms, you won't appear—even if you're highly qualified.\n\n---\n\n## The 4 Fields That Impact Your Visibility\n\nLinkedIn's algorithm weights certain sections more heavily than others. These are the four fields that matter most for search:\n\n### 1. Headline\nYour headline is the most heavily weighted field. It appears everywhere—search results, connection requests, comments, posts. Don't just write \"Full Stack Developer.\" Add 2-3 more keywords to maximize visibility.\n\n### 2. About Section\nLinkedIn scans your About section for relevant skills and job titles. This is searchable real estate—use it strategically.\n\n### 3. Experience Section\nJob titles, skills mentioned, and project descriptions are all indexed. Each role is an opportunity to include searchable terms.\n\n### 4. Skills Section\nYour top 50 skills are searchable and contribute to recruiter search ranking. This section directly impacts whether you appear in filtered searches.\n\n---\n\n## The Mirroring Principle\n\nHere's the critical concept most job seekers miss: **You must use the exact words recruiters use—not just words you prefer.**\n\n### The Problem\n\nImagine a recruiter searches for \"React Developer.\" Your profile says \"Front-end engineer specializing in UI/UX.\"\n\nEven though your experience matches perfectly, your profile won't appear. LinkedIn matches words literally. If the words don't match, you don't show up.\n\n### The Solution\n\nMirror the language from job postings back into your profile.\n\n| Recruiter Searches For | Your Profile Should Say |\n|------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Full Stack Developer | Headline: \"Full Stack Developer\" |\n| Software Engineer | About: \"As a software engineer, I build...\" |\n| React, NodeJS, JavaScript | Skills: React, NodeJS, JavaScript |\n| API, PostgreSQL, AWS | Experience: \"Developed RESTful APIs using NodeJS and PostgreSQL, deployed to AWS\" |\n\n---\n\n## Before and After: Optimization in Action\n\n### Before (Invisible)\n\n**Headline:** Passionate developer, problem solver, creative thinker\n\n**About:** I enjoy learning new technologies and building cool projects. I love collaborating with others and continuously improving my skills.\n\n**Skills:** Teamwork, HTML, CSS, JavaScript\n\n### After (Optimized)\n\n**Headline:** Full Stack Developer | JavaScript | React | NodeJS | API Integration\n\n**About:** I am a full stack developer specializing in React and NodeJS with experience building REST APIs, integrating PostgreSQL databases, and deploying applications on AWS. I'm passionate about clean code, scalable systems, and collaboration in agile environments.\n\n**Skills:** React, NodeJS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, API Development, AWS\n\n### Why It Works\n\n- The headline matches recruiter search titles\n- The About section repeats and contextualizes keywords\n- The Skills section supports the same language\n- No keyword stuffing—each term is used in context\n\n---\n\n## How to Find the Right Keywords\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Target Job Postings\n\nReview 3-5 job postings for roles you want. Highlight the terms that repeat across multiple postings—these are the keywords recruiters search for.\n\nLook for:\n- Job title variations (Software Engineer, Full Stack Developer, Front-End Engineer)\n- Technical skills (React, TypeScript, AWS, PostgreSQL)\n- Methodologies (Agile, CI/CD, TDD)\n\n### Step 2: Embed Keywords Across Your Profile\n\nOnce you've identified your keywords, place them in:\n\n- **Headline:** Target title + top 3 skills\n- **About:** Use phrases recruiters actually type\n- **Experience:** Tie each project to target keywords\n- **Skills:** Add every hard skill from multiple job postings\n\n### Step 3: Include Variations\n\nRecruiters may search different versions of the same term. Include variations:\n\n- API and REST API\n- ReactJS and React\n- AWS and Amazon Web Services\n- SQL and PostgreSQL\n\n---\n\n## Understanding Boolean Search Operators\n\nOnce you know how boolean searches work, you can test your own profile's visibility.\n\n| Operator | Function | Example |\n|----------|----------|---------|\n| **AND** | Both terms required | `\"Software Engineer\" AND Amazon` |\n| **OR** | Either term works | `\"Full Stack\" OR \"Front-End\"` |\n| **NOT** | Excludes a term | `Recruiter NOT Agency` |\n| **\"Quotes\"** | Exact phrase match | `\"Machine Learning Engineer\"` |\n| **(Parentheses)** | Groups conditions | `(\"Full Stack\" OR \"Software Engineer\") AND React` |\n\nTry searching for your target role on LinkedIn. See what profiles appear. Then ask yourself: does my profile contain the same language?\n\n---\n\n## Active Profiles Rank Higher\n\nKeywords alone aren't enough. LinkedIn favors profiles that show activity:\n\n- **Post at least once a week** using relevant keywords (\"Excited to finish my React app today\")\n- **Comment on posts** using industry language\n- **Follow companies** in your target industry—this signals interest to recruiters\n- **Engage with recruiter content**—they notice who interacts with their posts\n\nVisibility builds on itself. The more active you are, the more you appear in searches.\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Recruiters search by keywords**—if your profile doesn't contain them, you're invisible\n2. **90% of recruiters use keyword filters** to find candidates\n3. **Mirror the exact language** from job postings into your profile\n4. **Keywords must appear in all four key sections:** headline, about, experience, and skills\n5. **Avoid keyword stuffing**—use terms in real sentences with context\n6. **Include title variations** (Full Stack Developer, Software Engineer, Web Developer)\n7. **Active engagement boosts search ranking**—post, comment, and follow\n8. **Following companies signals interest** to recruiters at those organizations\n\n---\n\n## Your Action Items\n\n1. Pull up 3-5 job postings for your target role\n2. Highlight keywords that appear in multiple postings\n3. Check your LinkedIn profile—are those keywords present?\n4. Update your headline with your target title + top 3 skills\n5. Revise your About section to include key terms in context\n6. Add missing hard skills to your Skills section\n7. Set a reminder to post once this week with a relevant keyword\n\n---\n\n*This series is based on career coaching from [Chelsea Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chelseascott/), adapted for SpokeToWork.com.*\n\n**Next in the series:** [Part 2: Tell Your Story—Headline, About & Experience That Connect](/blog/linkedin-optimization-tell-your-story)\n\n---\n\n_Have questions?

SpokeToWork helps you stay organized with a simple system for tracking companies and applications - all kept private and secure on your own account.\n\n## What SpokeToWork Helps You Do\n\nSpokeToWork is designed for job seekers who want to:\n\n- **Keep track of companies** you're interested in working for\n- **Manage job applications** from \"Applied\" through interviews to offers\n- **Plan visits** to companies (great for delivery drivers, sales roles, or just dropping off resumes)\n- **Stay organized** with notes, contacts, and follow-up reminders\n- **Connect with others** through private, encrypted messaging\n\nLet's walk through setting up your account and tracking your first application.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Set Your Home Location\n\nBefore adding companies, head to the **Companies** page and set your **Home Location**. This lets SpokeToWork calculate distances and plan efficient routes to potential employers.\n\n![Setting your home location](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/home-location-settings.png)\n_Enter your address and click Geocode to set your starting point_\n\nFor this walkthrough, we're starting from **Community Kitchen** (727 E 11th St, Chattanooga, TN 37403) - a real resource in downtown Chattanooga that helps folks getting back on their feet.\n\nSetting your home location first means every company you add will automatically show you how far away it is - helpful when you're planning visits by bike or on foot.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Add Your First Company\n\nHead to the **Companies** page. This is where you'll build your list of potential employers.\n\n### Adding the Chattanooga Public Library\n\nClick **Add Company** to open the form. Let's add a real location:\n\n![Adding a company to your list](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/add-company-form.png)\n_The company form lets you capture all the details you need_\n\nFill in the basics:\n\n- **Company Name**: Chattanooga Public Library\n- **Address**: 1001 Broad St, Chattanooga, TN 37402\n- **Website**: https://chattlibrary.org\n- **Phone**: (423) 757-5310\n\n### Adding Contact Information\n\nThe best job searches involve real connections. Add your contact at the company:\n\n- **Contact Name**: Human Resources\n- **Contact Title**: HR Department\n- **Email**: jobs@chattlibrary.org\n\n### Setting Status and Priority\n\nUse status to track where you are with each company:\n\n- **Not Contacted** - Companies you're researching\n- **Contacted** - You've reached out\n- **Follow Up** - Need to check back\n- **Meeting Scheduled** - Interview scheduled\n- **Positive Outcome** - Got the job!\n- **Negative Outcome** - Didn't work out (but you learned something)\n\nSet **Priority** (1-5) to focus on your top picks first.\n\n### Notes for Future You\n\nUse the **Notes** field for anything helpful:\n\n> \"Saw job posting for Library Assistant position. Hours are flexible, good for someone rebuilding. Apply online or in person.\"\n\nClick **Save** and your company is tracked!\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: View Your Companies\n\n![The companies list showing your tracked locations](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/companies-list.png)\n_Your company list shows status, priority, and latest application at a glance_\n\nYour companies page shows:\n\n- Company name and location\n- Current status (color-coded for quick scanning)\n- Priority level\n- Most recent application status\n- Quick actions to edit, view details, or delete\n\nClick any company to see the full details drawer with all your notes, contacts, and applications.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Track a Job Application\n\nFound a job posting? Let's track it!\n\n### Adding an Application\n\nClick on the Chattanooga Public Library to open the details drawer, then click the **Add** button next to the Applications header (or **Add your first application** if you haven't added any yet).\n\n![Adding a job application](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/add-application.png)\n_Track each application with position details and dates_\n\nFill in:\n\n- **Position Title**: Library Assistant\n- **Date Applied**: December 14, 2025\n- **Status**: Applied\n\n### Application Statuses\n\nSpokeToWork tracks your application through each stage:\n\n- **Not Applied** - You're interested but haven't applied yet\n- **Applied** - Application submitted\n- **Screening** - Initial review, phone screen\n- **Interviewing** - In-person or video interviews\n- **Offer** - They made you an offer!\n- **Closed** - Position filled or you moved on\n\n### Tracking Outcomes\n\nWhen an application concludes, record the outcome:\n\n- **Pending** - Still in progress\n- **Hired** - You got the job!\n- **Rejected** - They said no (it happens)\n- **Withdrawn** - You decided to pass\n- **Ghosted** - Never heard back (unfortunately common)\n\nThis data helps you understand your job search patterns over time.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Plan Your Visits with Routes\n\nFor job hunters who want to visit companies in person - whether to drop off a resume, scope out the location, or attend an interview - SpokeToWork includes bicycle route planning.\n\n![Route planning sidebar showing companies to visit](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/route-sidebar.png)\n_Plan your route and mark which companies to visit on your next trip_\n\n### Creating a Route\n\n1. Click the **New** button in the Routes sidebar\n2. Name it (e.g., \"Downtown Chattanooga - Week 1\")\n3. Add companies from your list to the route\n4. Drag to reorder your stops\n\nFor example, a route from Community Kitchen to the library, then to other downtown locations like the Chattanooga Convention Center or City Hall - all within biking distance.\n\n### The \"Next Ride\" Feature\n\nMark companies with **Next** to highlight which ones you'll visit on your next trip. This keeps your route focused when you have many companies saved.\n\n### View on the Map\n\nNavigate to the **Map** page from the main navigation to see all your companies plotted on an interactive map. The route line shows the suggested path between stops.\n\n![Interactive map showing company locations](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/map-view.png)\n_See your companies on a map with the planned route_\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Privacy and Security\n\nYour job search is personal. Here's how SpokeToWork handles your data:\n\n- **Your Data, Your Account**: Companies and applications are private to your account - only you can see them\n- **Encrypted Messaging**: If you connect with other job seekers, messages are end-to-end encrypted. We literally cannot read them, even if we wanted to\n- **Anonymous Analytics**: We use Google Analytics to understand how people use the app (which pages are popular, where users get stuck). This data is anonymous - we see trends, not individuals. We never sell this data.\n- **No Data Selling**: We don't sell your personal information to advertisers or third parties\n\nLearn more about our encryption in our [security explainer](/blog/message-encryption-security-explained).\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference: Job Application Workflow\n\nHere's a typical workflow for tracking a job opportunity:\n\n1. **Set up**: Configure your home location in your profile\n2. **Research**: Find a company you like, add it to SpokeToWork with status \"Not Contacted\"\n3. **Reach Out**: Apply for a position, update status to \"Contacted\", add an application with \"Applied\"\n4. **Follow Up**: Set a follow-up date, add notes about any conversations\n5. **Interview**: Update application status to \"Interviewing\", add interview date\n6. **Result**: Record the outcome - celebrate if hired, learn if not\n\n---\n\n## Tips for Job Search Success\n\n### Keep Notes Updated\n\nFuture you will thank present you for detailed notes. Write down:\n\n- Who you talked to and when\n- What they said about the role\n- Any requirements or next steps mentioned\n\n### Use Priority Wisely\n\nNot all opportunities are equal. Rank your dream jobs higher so you focus energy where it matters most.\n\n### Check In Weekly\n\nSet aside time each week to:\n\n- Review your application statuses\n- Update any companies where things have changed\n- Add new companies you've discovered\n\n### Don't Take Ghosting Personally\n\nIf a company never responds, mark it and move on. The outcome tracking helps you see patterns - some industries are worse about this than others.\n\n---\n\n## What's Next?\n\nYou're ready to start organizing your job search! Here's what to do:\n\n1. **Sign up** or log in to your account\n2. **Set your home location** in your profile\n3. **Add 3-5 companies** you're interested in\n4. **Track at least one application** to see how it works\n5. **Explore the map** if you plan to visit any locations\n\nGood luck with your job search! SpokeToWork is here to help you stay organized and focused on what matters: finding the right opportunity.\n\n---\n\n_Have questions?

      "content": "\n# 3 Security Layers Protecting Your Messages\n\nWhen you're job hunting, you might share sensitive information - salary expectations, interview feedback, or personal challenges. SpokeToWork protects these conversations with **end-to-end encryption (E2E)**, the same security used by Signal and WhatsApp.\n\n## What Does \"End-to-End Encrypted\" Mean?\n\n**Simple answer**: Only you and the person you're messaging can read your messages. Nobody else - not us, not hackers, not anyone.\n\nHere's how it works in plain terms:\n\n1. **Your message gets scrambled** on your device before it leaves\n2. **Only scrambled text travels** over the internet and sits on our servers\n3. **Your recipient's device unscrambles it** using a key only they have\n\nEven if someone broke into our database, they'd find gibberish - encrypted text that's useless without the decryption keys, which we never have.\n\n---\n\n## How SpokeToWork Compares to Other Apps\n\n![Encryption comparison chart](/blog-images/message-encryption-security-explained/comparison-chart.png)\n_How different messaging apps handle your privacy_\n\n| Feature                       | SpokeToWork | Standard Email | Social Media DMs |\n| ----------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- |\n| End-to-End Encrypted          | Yes         | No             | Usually No       |\n| Server Can Read Messages      | No          | Yes            | Yes              |\n| Your Data Sold to Advertisers | No          | Often          | Yes              |\n| Open Source Security          | Yes         | Varies         | No               |\n\n---\n\n## The Technical Details (For the Curious)\n\nIf you're interested in how the encryption actually works, here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Exchange: ECDH P-256\n\nWhen you connect with someone, your devices perform a mathematical handshake called **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)**. This creates a shared secret that only your two devices know - without ever sending the secret over the internet.\n\n### Message Encryption: AES-GCM-256\n\nEach message is encrypted using **AES-GCM** with a 256-bit key. This is the same encryption standard used by banks and governments. Each message gets a unique random value (called an IV) so even identical messages look different when encrypted.\n\n### Password-Derived Keys: Argon2id\n\nYour encryption keys are derived from your password using **Argon2id**, a memory-hard algorithm that's resistant to brute-force attacks. This means:\n\n- Same password always generates the same keys\n- You can access your messages from any device by logging in\n- Changing your password rotates your keys\n\n### What We Store vs. What We Don't\n\n| We Store                                       | We Don't Store     |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |\n| Your public key (for others to encrypt to you) | Your private key   |\n| Encrypted message content (ciphertext)         | Decrypted messages |\n| Message timestamps                             | Message content    |\n| Your profile info                              | Your password      |\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters for Job Seekers\n\nDuring a job search, you might discuss:\n\n- **Salary negotiations** - What you're making, what you want\n- **Interview experiences** - Honest feedback about companies\n- **Personal situations** - Why you're leaving, health issues, family needs\n- **References** - People vouching for you privately\n\nThis information is sensitive. With end-to-end encryption, you can share freely knowing that your conversations are private - even from us.\n\n---\n\n## Common Questions\n\n### Can SpokeToWork read my messages?\n\n**No.** We literally cannot decrypt your messages. We don't have the keys.\n\n### What if I forget my password?\n\nYour encryption keys are derived from your password. If you reset your password, you'll generate new keys. You'll still be able to start new conversations, but old messages encrypted with your previous keys won't be recoverable.\n\n### Is this as secure as Signal?\n\nWe use the same cryptographic primitives (ECDH, AES-GCM) and the same zero-knowledge architecture. The main difference is that Signal has been audited by third-party security researchers, while SpokeToWork is newer. Our code is open source, so you can verify the implementation yourself.\n\n### What about metadata?\n\nWe can see _that_ you messaged someone and _when_, but not _what_ you said. This is similar to how your phone company can see you made a call but can't hear the conversation.\n\n---\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nYour job search conversations are private. End-to-end encryption ensures that only you and your recipient can read your messages - not us, not advertisers, not anyone else.\n\nWant to learn more about our security practices?
