# LinkedIn: Stay Visible with Networking & Posts

_Part 4 of 4 in the LinkedIn Optimization Series_

**Series:** [Part 1: Get Found](/blog/linkedin-optimization-get-found) | [Part 2: Tell Your Story](/blog/linkedin-optimization-tell-your-story) | [Part 3: Build Proof](/blog/linkedin-optimization-build-proof) | [Part 4: Stay Visible]

You've optimized your profile for search. You've crafted a compelling story. You've backed it up with skills and recommendations. Now comes the part most people skip: staying visible.

A perfect profile that sits dormant is like a storefront with the lights off. LinkedIn rewards activity. The more you engage, the more you appear in searches and feeds. And the more visible you are, the more opportunities find you.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **70-85% of roles are filled through networking.** Many positions are never posted publicly—they're shared through internal referrals and recommendations. A referral can move your application from a pile of 500 to the top 10 considered in under 24 hours.

This isn't about being pushy. It's about being present.

## The PEAR Framework: Who to Connect With

When building your network, think **PEAR**:

| Letter | Category             | Examples                                                           |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **P**  | Peers                | Developers a step ahead of you, people at target companies         |
| **E**  | Employers            | Hiring managers, recruiters at companies you're interested in      |
| **A**  | Alumni               | Boot camp graduates, university alumni, former colleagues          |
| **R**  | Relevant Communities | Meetup organizers, Discord/Slack members, open source contributors |

You don't have to know these people personally. Shared context—like attending the same program or working in the same industry—builds trust fast.

## The Personalization Formula

Generic connection requests get ignored. Personalized ones get accepted.

**Formula: Context + Relevance + Small Ask**

### Example

> "Hi Kai, fellow TechJoy alum here. Saw your work on [specific project]. Would love to connect and follow your updates."

### Why It Works

- Shows you're not mass-messaging
- Creates immediate common ground
- Makes it easy to say yes

### What to Avoid

- Generic messages: "I'd like to add you to my professional network"
- Asking for referrals before building rapport
- Walls of text

Keep it to 2-3 sentences. Make the ask small ("would love to connect" vs. "can you refer me?").

---

## Nurturing Relationships: The Long Game

The strongest networks come from relationships that feel natural, human, and mutually supportive. Think of it like watering a plant—small check-ins keep the connection alive.

### Four Principles

1. **Consistency** - Small touchpoints every few months
2. **Curiosity** - Ask about their work, not just what you need
3. **Gratitude** - A simple thank-you goes far
4. **Value sharing** - Share something useful without expecting anything back

### Check-In Templates (Non-Transactional)

**Context-based:**

> "Hi Jordan, I just saw an article about UX design trends and it reminded me of the conversation we had. How have things been on your end?"

**Curiosity-driven:**

> "Hi Sam, I remember you mentioned starting a new role around the time we last spoke. How has that transition been?"

**After a milestone:**

> "Hey Chris, congrats on your 2-year anniversary at Company X. How has your role grown since you started?"

**After they posted something:**

> "Hi Taylor, I really enjoyed that post on AI trends. What's been the most surprising change you've seen so far?"

### What to Avoid

- "Hi, I'm job hunting and wondered if you'd know of any openings."
- "Hey, we haven't talked in a while. Can you refer me?"
- "Do you have 15 minutes for a call?" (without context)

Build rapport before making requests.

---

## The Coffee Chat Approach

Reaching out to people at target companies for virtual coffee chats has proven highly effective.

### What Happens

- Some people accept and have great conversations
- Some can't meet but offer to answer questions via message
- Some don't respond (that's okay)

### Questions to Ask

- What do you enjoy most about working there?
- What skills matter most for roles like this?
- How has your role evolved since you started?
- What surprised you about the company or industry?

### After the Chat

Keep in touch. Congratulate them on milestones. Check in when they change jobs. The people who helped you once are likely to help again.

## Messaging & Cold Outreach

In 2025, short beats long. Hiring managers and recruiters skim messages on their phones between meetings. Your message needs to be readable in 15-20 seconds.

### The 3-1-1 Formula

- **3 words of context** ("Fellow TechJoy alum", "Saw your talk")
- **1 line** specific about them
- **1 micro ask**

### The TACO Close

**T**iny **A**sk, **C**lear **O**utcome

- "Could you share one suggestion on...?"
- "Is it worth applying for X, or is Y a better fit?"
- "If there's a better contact, happy to reach out."

### Example Messages

**To an alum:**

> "Hello, fellow TechJoy alum here. I saw your post about onboarding developers. One quick question: if you had to pick between Spring Boot and Flask for AI-focused projects, which would you suggest?"

**To a hiring manager (after applying):**

> "Hi Priya, I applied to the full-stack role on Monday. Two strengths I'd bring: designing REST APIs and building low-code solutions. Would a quick note on your top success criteria help me tailor my examples?"

**To a recruiter:**

> "Hi Taylor, I'm a full-stack developer with Python, React, and low-code experience. Based in [city], open to hybrid or remote. If you're open, is there one opportunity I should have on my radar this week?"

### Follow-Up Sequence

| Day    | Action                                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Day 1  | Initial connection note                                            |
| Day 3  | First follow-up ("Bumping this in case it was buried...")          |
| Day 7  | Value-add note (share a relevant article)                          |
| Day 14 | Graceful close ("Closing the loop so I don't crowd your inbox...") |

## Posting: Show Your Work

Posting makes you visible to people beyond your immediate network. Recruiters often find candidates through their posts and comments.

### Frequency

**2-3 times per week** is the sweet spot—visible without oversharing.

### Post Types That Work

**Learning journey posts:**

> What you're coding, building, or struggling with

**Project work with insight:**

> Not just "I made this" but "Here's what I made and why it matters"

**Industry commentary:**

> Your reaction to AI trends, tech news, hiring changes

**Gratitude posts:**

> Shout out to mentors, teammates, or people who helped

### Post Structure

1. **Hook line** - Draws people in (only a preview shows before "see more")
2. **Body (3-5 sentences)** - What you're working on, why it matters, what you learned
3. **Call to action** - Ask a question, invite comments, share gratitude

### Example Post

> "This week I built my first full-stack project at TechJoy Academy. It challenged me to think about user flows and debugging in new ways. I learned that breaking problems into smaller parts makes solutions faster and cleaner. Curious how others approach debugging when they're stuck on code."

---

## Commenting: Add Value Every Time

Comments put you directly on recruiters' and hiring managers' radar. They care about what you think.

### Don't Write

> "Great post!"

### Do Write

> "This is spot on. I've been applying this in my projects by [specific example]."

### Strong Comment Starters

- "This aligns with what I've been seeing in my projects."
- "I agree with your point on [X]. In my experience, [Y] has also been important."
- "Thanks for sharing. I've been exploring similar approaches in my coding journey."

### The Comment → DM Strategy

1. Comment on someone's post
2. Follow up with a DM referencing your comment
3. The DM feels warmer because you've already engaged

---

## Hashtag Strategy

Hashtags categorize your posts, expand visibility, and signal keywords to recruiters.

### Best Practices

- Use **3-5 hashtags max**
- Mix broad and niche tags
- Check activity before using (inactive hashtags won't help)

### Example Hashtags

- #FullStackDeveloper
- #OpenToWork
- #React
- #AI
- #CareerGrowth
- #TechHiring
- #WomenWhoCode

---

## Following Companies

When you **follow a company**, your interest shows up in recruiter searches. This signals that you're interested in their organization—even before you apply.

Follow:

- Target companies you want to work for
- Companies where people in your network work
- Companies posting about topics you care about

---

## Time Investment

**10-15 minutes a day** is enough to stay visible.

- Scroll your feed
- Comment on 1-2 posts
- Post 2-3 times per week
- Send a few connection requests

Consistency beats intensity. Small actions compound over time.
