# Get Found: How Recruiters Actually Search LinkedIn

_Part 1 of 4 in the LinkedIn Optimization Series_

**Series:** [Part 1: Get Found] | [Part 2: Tell Your Story](/blog/linkedin-optimization-tell-your-story) | [Part 3: Build Proof](/blog/linkedin-optimization-build-proof) | [Part 4: Stay Visible](/blog/linkedin-optimization-stay-visible)

You could have the perfect background for a role and never get contacted. Not because you're unqualified—but because recruiters literally can't find you.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **95% of recruiters use LinkedIn daily to source talent**. And 90% of them rely on keyword filters to narrow down candidates. If your profile doesn't contain the exact words they're searching for, you're invisible.

The good news? Once you understand how recruiters search, you can optimize your profile to show up.

---

## How Recruiters Actually Find Candidates

Recruiters don't browse LinkedIn hoping to stumble across great candidates. They search it—the same way you search Google.

They use a paid tool called **LinkedIn Recruiter** that lets them build complex searches using:

- **Keywords** (job titles, skills, technologies)
- **Location filters** (remote, hybrid, on-site)
- **Experience level**
- **Industry**

Here's what a typical recruiter search string looks like:

```
("Full Stack Developer" OR "Software Engineer") AND (React OR NodeJS OR JavaScript) AND (API OR PostgreSQL OR AWS)
```

This tells LinkedIn: _"Find me developers who know React, NodeJS, or JavaScript AND have experience with APIs, PostgreSQL, or AWS."_

If your profile doesn't contain those exact terms, you won't appear—even if you're highly qualified.

## The 4 Fields That Impact Your Visibility

LinkedIn's algorithm weights certain sections more heavily than others. These are the four fields that matter most for search:

### 1. Headline

Your headline is the most heavily weighted field. It appears everywhere—search results, connection requests, comments, posts. Don't just write "Full Stack Developer." Add 2-3 more keywords to maximize visibility.

### 2. About Section

LinkedIn scans your About section for relevant skills and job titles. This is searchable real estate—use it strategically.

### 3. Experience Section

Job titles, skills mentioned, and project descriptions are all indexed. Each role is an opportunity to include searchable terms.

### 4. Skills Section

Your top 50 skills are searchable and contribute to recruiter search ranking. This section directly impacts whether you appear in filtered searches.

---

## The Mirroring Principle

Here's the critical concept most job seekers miss: **You must use the exact words recruiters use—not just words you prefer.**

### The Problem

Imagine a recruiter searches for "React Developer." Your profile says "Front-end engineer specializing in UI/UX."

Even though your experience matches perfectly, your profile won't appear. LinkedIn matches words literally. If the words don't match, you don't show up.

### The Solution

Mirror the language from job postings back into your profile.

| Recruiter Searches For    | Your Profile Should Say                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full Stack Developer      | Headline: "Full Stack Developer"                                                  |
| Software Engineer         | About: "As a software engineer, I build..."                                       |
| React, NodeJS, JavaScript | Skills: React, NodeJS, JavaScript                                                 |
| API, PostgreSQL, AWS      | Experience: "Developed RESTful APIs using NodeJS and PostgreSQL, deployed to AWS" |

## Before and After: Optimization in Action

### Before (Invisible)

**Headline:** Passionate developer, problem solver, creative thinker

**About:** I enjoy learning new technologies and building cool projects. I love collaborating with others and continuously improving my skills.

**Skills:** Teamwork, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### After (Optimized)

**Headline:** Full Stack Developer | JavaScript | React | NodeJS | API Integration

**About:** I am a full stack developer specializing in React and NodeJS with experience building REST APIs, integrating PostgreSQL databases, and deploying applications on AWS. I'm passionate about clean code, scalable systems, and collaboration in agile environments.

**Skills:** React, NodeJS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, API Development, AWS

### Why It Works

- The headline matches recruiter search titles
- The About section repeats and contextualizes keywords
- The Skills section supports the same language
- No keyword stuffing—each term is used in context

---

## How to Find the Right Keywords

### Step 1: Analyze Target Job Postings

Review 3-5 job postings for roles you want. Highlight the terms that repeat across multiple postings—these are the keywords recruiters search for.

Look for:

- Job title variations (Software Engineer, Full Stack Developer, Front-End Engineer)
- Technical skills (React, TypeScript, AWS, PostgreSQL)
- Methodologies (Agile, CI/CD, TDD)

### Step 2: Embed Keywords Across Your Profile

Once you've identified your keywords, place them in:

- **Headline:** Target title + top 3 skills
- **About:** Use phrases recruiters actually type
- **Experience:** Tie each project to target keywords
- **Skills:** Add every hard skill from multiple job postings

### Step 3: Include Variations

Recruiters may search different versions of the same term. Include variations:

- API and REST API
- ReactJS and React
- AWS and Amazon Web Services
- SQL and PostgreSQL

## Understanding Boolean Search Operators

Once you know how boolean searches work, you can test your own profile's visibility.

| Operator          | Function            | Example                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **AND**           | Both terms required | `"Software Engineer" AND Amazon`                  |
| **OR**            | Either term works   | `"Full Stack" OR "Front-End"`                     |
| **NOT**           | Excludes a term     | `Recruiter NOT Agency`                            |
| **"Quotes"**      | Exact phrase match  | `"Machine Learning Engineer"`                     |
| **(Parentheses)** | Groups conditions   | `("Full Stack" OR "Software Engineer") AND React` |

Try searching for your target role on LinkedIn. See what profiles appear. Then ask yourself: does my profile contain the same language?

---

## Active Profiles Rank Higher

Keywords alone aren't enough. LinkedIn favors profiles that show activity:

- **Post at least once a week** using relevant keywords ("Excited to finish my React app today")
- **Comment on posts** using industry language
- **Follow companies** in your target industry—this signals interest to recruiters
- **Engage with recruiter content**—they notice who interacts with their posts

Visibility builds on itself. The more active you are, the more you appear in searches.
