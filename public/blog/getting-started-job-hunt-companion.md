# Essential Job Search Guide: 6 Steps to Organize Your Hunt with SpokeToWork

Job hunting is stressful enough without losing track of which companies you've applied to, who you talked to, and when you need to follow up. SpokeToWork helps you stay organized with a simple system for tracking companies and applications - all kept private and secure on your own account.

## What SpokeToWork Helps You Do

SpokeToWork is designed for job seekers who want to:

- **Keep track of companies** you're interested in working for
- **Manage job applications** from "Applied" through interviews to offers
- **Plan visits** to companies (great for delivery drivers, sales roles, or just dropping off resumes)
- **Stay organized** with notes, contacts, and follow-up reminders
- **Connect with others** through private, encrypted messaging

Let's walk through setting up your account and tracking your first application.

---

## Step 1: Set Your Home Location

Before adding companies, head to the **Companies** page and set your **Home Location**. This lets SpokeToWork calculate distances and plan efficient routes to potential employers.

![Setting your home location](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/home-location-settings.png)
_Enter your address and click Geocode to set your starting point_

For this walkthrough, we're starting from **Community Kitchen** (727 E 11th St, Chattanooga, TN 37403) - a real resource in downtown Chattanooga that helps folks getting back on their feet.

Setting your home location first means every company you add will automatically show you how far away it is - helpful when you're planning visits by bike or on foot.

---

## Step 2: Add Your First Company

Head to the **Companies** page. This is where you'll build your list of potential employers.

### Adding the Chattanooga Public Library

Click **Add Company** to open the form. Let's add a real location:

![Adding a company to your list](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/add-company-form.png)
_The company form lets you capture all the details you need_

Fill in the basics:

- **Company Name**: Chattanooga Public Library
- **Address**: 1001 Broad St, Chattanooga, TN 37402
- **Website**: https://chattlibrary.org
- **Phone**: (423) 757-5310

### Adding Contact Information

The best job searches involve real connections. Add your contact at the company:

- **Contact Name**: Human Resources
- **Contact Title**: HR Department
- **Email**: jobs@chattlibrary.org

### Setting Status and Priority

Use status to track where you are with each company:

- **Not Contacted** - Companies you're researching
- **Contacted** - You've reached out
- **Follow Up** - Need to check back
- **Meeting Scheduled** - Interview scheduled
- **Positive Outcome** - Got the job!
- **Negative Outcome** - Didn't work out (but you learned something)

Set **Priority** (1-5) to focus on your top picks first.

### Notes for Future You

Use the **Notes** field for anything helpful:

> "Saw job posting for Library Assistant position. Hours are flexible, good for someone rebuilding. Apply online or in person."

Click **Save** and your company is tracked!

## Step 3: View Your Companies

_Your company list shows status, priority, and latest application at a glance_

Your companies page shows:

- Company name and location
- Current status (color-coded for quick scanning)
- Priority level
- Most recent application status
- Quick actions to edit, view details, or delete

Click any company to see the full details drawer with all your notes, contacts, and applications.

## Step 4: Track a Job Application

Found a job posting? Let's track it!

### Adding an Application

Click on the Chattanooga Public Library to open the details drawer, then click the **Add** button next to the Applications header (or **Add your first application** if you haven't added any yet).

![Adding a job application](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/add-application.png)
_Track each application with position details and dates_

Fill in:

- **Position Title**: Library Assistant
- **Date Applied**: December 14, 2025
- **Status**: Applied

### Application Statuses

SpokeToWork tracks your application through each stage:

- **Not Applied** - You're interested but haven't applied yet
- **Applied** - Application submitted
- **Screening** - Initial review, phone screen
- **Interviewing** - In-person or video interviews
- **Offer** - They made you an offer!
- **Closed** - Position filled or you moved on

### Tracking Outcomes

When an application concludes, record the outcome:

- **Pending** - Still in progress
- **Hired** - You got the job!
- **Rejected** - They said no (it happens)
- **Withdrawn** - You decided to pass
- **Ghosted** - Never heard back (unfortunately common)

This data helps you understand your job search patterns over time.

## Step 5: Plan Your Visits with Routes

For job hunters who want to visit companies in person - whether to drop off a resume, scope out the location, or attend an interview - SpokeToWork includes bicycle route planning.

![Route planning sidebar showing companies to visit](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/route-sidebar.png)
_Plan your route and mark which companies to visit on your next trip_

### Creating a Route

1. Click the **New** button in the Routes sidebar
2. Name it (e.g., "Downtown Chattanooga - Week 1")
3. Add companies from your list to the route
4. Drag to reorder your stops

For example, a route from Community Kitchen to the library, then to other downtown locations like the Chattanooga Convention Center or City Hall - all within biking distance.

### The "Next Ride" Feature

Mark companies with **Next** to highlight which ones you'll visit on your next trip. This keeps your route focused when you have many companies saved.

### View on the Map

Navigate to the **Map** page from the main navigation to see all your companies plotted on an interactive map. The route line shows the suggested path between stops.

## Step 6: Privacy and Security

Your job search is personal. Here's how SpokeToWork handles your data:

- **Your Data, Your Account**: Companies and applications are private to your account - only you can see them
- **Encrypted Messaging**: If you connect with other job seekers, messages are end-to-end encrypted. We literally cannot read them, even if we wanted to
- **Anonymous Analytics**: We use Google Analytics to understand how people use the app (which pages are popular, where users get stuck). This data is anonymous - we see trends, not individuals. We never sell this data.
- **No Data Selling**: We don't sell your personal information to advertisers or third parties

## Quick Reference: Job Application Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for tracking a job opportunity:

1. **Set up**: Configure your home location in your profile
2. **Research**: Find a company you like, add it to SpokeToWork with status "Not Contacted"
3. **Reach Out**: Apply for a position, update status to "Contacted", add an application with "Applied"
4. **Follow Up**: Set a follow-up date, add notes about any conversations
5. **Interview**: Update application status to "Interviewing", add interview date
6. **Result**: Record the outcome - celebrate if hired, learn if not

## Tips for Job Search Success

### Keep Notes Updated

Future you will thank present you for detailed notes. Write down:

- Who you talked to and when
- What they said about the role
- Any requirements or next steps mentioned

### Use Priority Wisely

Not all opportunities are equal. Rank your dream jobs higher so you focus energy where it matters most.

### Check In Weekly

Set aside time each week to:

- Review your application statuses
- Update any companies where things have changed
- Add new companies you've discovered

### Don't Take Ghosting Personally

If a company never responds, mark it and move on. The outcome tracking helps you see patterns - some industries are worse about this than others.

## What's Next?

You're ready to start organizing your job search! Here's what to do:

1. **Sign up** or log in to your account
2. **Set your home location** in your profile
3. **Add 3-5 companies** you're interested in
4. **Track at least one application** to see how it works
