# Getting Started with SpokeToWork: Your Job Hunt Companion

Job hunting is stressful enough without losing track of which companies you've applied to, who you talked to, and when you need to follow up. SpokeToWork helps you stay organized with a simple system for tracking companies and applications - all kept private and secure on your own account.

## What SpokeToWork Helps You Do

SpokeToWork is designed for job seekers who want to:

- **Keep track of companies** you're interested in working for
- **Manage job applications** from "Applied" through interviews to offers
- **Plan visits** to companies (great for delivery drivers, sales roles, or just dropping off resumes)
- **Stay organized** with notes, contacts, and follow-up reminders
- **Connect with others** through private, encrypted messaging

Let's walk through adding your first company and tracking an application.

---

## Step 1: Add Your First Company

After signing in, head to the **Companies** page. Here's where you'll build your list of potential employers.

### Adding "Acme Corporation"

Click the **Add Company** button to open the form. Let's add a fictional company to see how it works:

![Adding Acme Corporation to your company list](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/add-company-form.png)
_The company form lets you capture all the details you need_

Fill in the basics:

- **Company Name**: Acme Corporation
- **Address**: 123 Innovation Drive, Tech City, CA 94000
- **Website**: https://acme-corp.example.com
- **Phone**: (555) 123-4567

### Adding Contact Information

The best job searches involve real connections. Add your contact at the company:

- **Contact Name**: Sarah Johnson
- **Contact Title**: HR Manager
- **Email**: sarah.johnson@acme-corp.example.com

### Setting Status and Priority

Use status to track where you are with each company:

- **Not Contacted** - Companies you're researching
- **Contacted** - You've reached out
- **Follow Up** - Need to check back
- **Meeting** - Interview scheduled
- **Positive Outcome** - Got the job!
- **Negative Outcome** - Didn't work out (but you learned something)

Set **Priority** (1-5) to focus on your top picks first.

### Notes for Future You

Use the **Notes** field for anything helpful:

> "Spoke with Sarah at job fair on 12/10. She mentioned they're expanding the delivery team in January. She said to follow up after the holidays."

Click **Save** and your company is tracked!

## Step 2: View Your Companies

_Your company list shows status, priority, and latest application at a glance_

Your companies page shows:

- Company name and location
- Current status (color-coded for quick scanning)
- Priority level
- Most recent application status
- Quick actions to edit, view details, or delete

Click any company to see the full details drawer with all your notes, contacts, and applications.

## Step 3: Track a Job Application

Found a job posting at Acme? Let's track it!

### Adding an Application

Click on Acme Corporation to open the details drawer, then click **Add Application**.

![Adding a job application for Acme](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/add-application.png)
_Track each application with position details and dates_

Fill in:

- **Position Title**: Delivery Driver
- **Date Applied**: December 14, 2025
- **Status**: Applied

### Application Statuses

SpokeToWork tracks your application through each stage:

| Status           | What It Means                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Not Applied**  | You're interested but haven't applied yet |
| **Applied**      | Application submitted                     |
| **Screening**    | Initial review, phone screen              |
| **Interviewing** | In-person or video interviews             |
| **Offer**        | They made you an offer!                   |
| **Closed**       | Position filled or you moved on           |

### Tracking Outcomes

When an application concludes, record the outcome:

- **Pending** - Still in progress
- **Hired** - You got the job!
- **Rejected** - They said no (it happens)
- **Withdrawn** - You decided to pass
- **Ghosted** - Never heard back (unfortunately common)

This data helps you understand your job search patterns over time.

## Step 4: Plan Your Visits with Routes

For job hunters who want to visit companies in person - whether to drop off a resume, scope out the location, or attend an interview - SpokeToWork includes bicycle route planning.

![Route planning sidebar showing companies to visit](/blog-images/getting-started-job-hunt-companion/route-sidebar.png)
_Plan your route and mark which companies to visit on your next trip_

### Creating a Route

1. Click **Create Route** in the sidebar
2. Name it (e.g., "Downtown Job Search - Week 1")
3. Add companies from your list to the route
4. Drag to reorder your stops

### The "Next Ride" Feature

Mark companies with **Next** to highlight which ones you'll visit on your next trip. This keeps your route focused when you have many companies saved.

### View on the Map

Click **View Map** to see all your companies plotted on an interactive map. The route line shows the suggested path between stops.

## Step 5: Staying Private and Secure

Your job search is personal. SpokeToWork takes privacy seriously:

- **Your Data, Your Account**: Companies and applications are private to your account
- **Encrypted Messaging**: If you connect with other job seekers, messages are end-to-end encrypted - we can't read them even if we wanted to
- **No Tracking**: We don't sell your data or track your browsing

## Quick Reference: Job Application Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for tracking a job opportunity:

1. **Research**: Find a company you like, add it to SpokeToWork with status "Not Contacted"
2. **Reach Out**: Apply for a position, update status to "Contacted", add an application with "Applied"
3. **Follow Up**: Set a follow-up date, add notes about any conversations
4. **Interview**: Update application status to "Interviewing", add interview date
5. **Result**: Record the outcome - celebrate if hired, learn if not

## Tips for Job Search Success

### Keep Notes Updated

Future you will thank present you for detailed notes. Write down:

- Who you talked to and when
- What they said about the role
- Any requirements or next steps mentioned

### Use Priority Wisely

Not all opportunities are equal. Rank your dream jobs higher so you focus energy where it matters most.

### Check In Weekly

Set aside time each week to:

- Review your application statuses
- Update any companies where things have changed
- Add new companies you've discovered

### Don't Take Ghosting Personally

If a company never responds, mark it and move on. The outcome tracking helps you see patterns - some industries are worse about this than others.

## What's Next?

You're ready to start organizing your job search! Here's what to do:

1. **Sign up** or log in to your account
2. **Add 3-5 companies** you're interested in
3. **Track at least one application** to see how it works
4. **Explore the map** if you plan to visit any locations
