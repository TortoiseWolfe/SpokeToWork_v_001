# LinkedIn: Build Proof with Skills & Projects

_Part 3 of 4 in the LinkedIn Optimization Series_

**Series:** [Part 1: Get Found](/blog/linkedin-optimization-get-found) | [Part 2: Tell Your Story](/blog/linkedin-optimization-tell-your-story) | [Part 3: Build Proof] | [Part 4: Stay Visible](/blog/linkedin-optimization-stay-visible)

You've optimized for search. You've crafted a compelling headline and About section. Now it's time to back it up.

Claims without proof are just words. Recruiters and hiring managers want validation—evidence that you can actually do what you say you can do. That's where your Skills section, Projects, and Recommendations come in.

These are your credibility markers. They transform your profile from a self-description into a verified portfolio.

## The Skills Section: Your Searchable Inventory

LinkedIn allows you to list up to 50 skills. ATS systems and LinkedIn Recruiter heavily rely on this section to filter candidates.

### Why Skills Matter for Search

When recruiters build searches, they filter by skills. If a recruiter searches for "React AND PostgreSQL" and those skills aren't in your profile, you won't appear—even if you mention them elsewhere in your text.

A lean skills section (only a few skills listed) signals either limited experience or someone who hasn't maintained their profile. Neither is a good look.

### How Many Skills to Add

- **Minimum:** 30 skills
- **Maximum:** 50 skills (LinkedIn's limit)
- **Per job:** 3-5 skills attached to each position

### What to Include

**Hard Skills (get you the interview):**

- Programming languages (JavaScript, Python, TypeScript)
- Frameworks and libraries (React, Node.js, Next.js)
- Tools (Git, GitHub, VS Code, Postman, Figma)
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL)
- Methodologies (Agile, CI/CD, TDD)

**Soft Skills (help you pass the interview and keep the job):**

- Problem solving
- Communication
- Collaboration
- Mentorship
- Time management
- Adaptability

Tech is a team sport. Hard skills show what you can build. Soft skills are your reputation—how you use your tools and work with others.

### Mentorship as a Skill

If you've mentored anyone—peers, junior team members, bootcamp classmates—add "Mentorship" as a skill. This signals leadership potential. Many organizations assign mentors to new hires, and they look for this capability.

### Skills Placement Strategy

1. **Top 3 skills** - Your most important, recruiter-searched skills
2. **Skills per job** - Add relevant skills to each position in your Experience section
3. **Endorsements** - Ask connections to endorse your key skills (this boosts credibility)

## Projects: Proof You've Built Real Things

Projects demonstrate that you've worked on real products with real teams—not just attended classes. For boot camp graduates and career changers, projects are especially critical.

### The Project Framework

**What it is + What tools you used + What you built + Impact/Result**

### Example With Metrics

> "Built a full-stack budgeting app using React, Node.js, and MongoDB that allowed users to track expenses. Designed UI for intuitive UX, deployed with Netlify. Reduced friction for new users by 25% in testing."

### Example Without Metrics

> "Collaborated with a team to build a task manager in four days. Delivered 100% complete and usable product by strict deadline following SLICK methodology (Simple, Lovable, Complete)."

### When to Include Metrics

Only include metrics if you can speak to them in detail during an interview. If you can't quantify the impact, focus on:

- What you built
- What technologies you used
- That you delivered a complete, working product

### Important Notes on Sharing Work

- **Always ask permission** before posting client work (some projects have NDAs)
- **Only post live, working links** - never broken links
- **Use password protection** for sensitive work samples
- **Tag collaborators** and give credit to team members

## Recommendations: Social Proof That Lives on Your Profile

Recommendations are mini-references that validate what you've said about yourself. They demonstrate credibility and build trust.

### Why Recommendations Matter

- **Hiring managers** scan recommendations before or after interviews to confirm impressions
- **Recruiters** use them as tie-breakers between equally strong candidates
- **Keywords in recommendations count** toward your profile's searchability

Recommendations are especially valuable for:

- **Career changers** - They highlight transferable skills and professionalism
- **Early-career professionals** - They show real-world collaboration abilities

### Types of Recommendations

Think broadly about who can vouch for you:

| Type                   | Who                               | What They Highlight             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Peer**               | Classmates, teammates, colleagues | Collaboration, teamwork         |
| **Manager/Supervisor** | Bosses, team leads                | Accountability, quality of work |
| **Mentor/Coach**       | Teachers, advisors                | Growth, learning, character     |
| **Client**             | Customers, stakeholders           | Reliability, outcomes           |

### When to Ask (Timing Matters)

- Right after completing a project or assignment
- After receiving positive feedback
- When wrapping up an internship, boot camp, or position

People's memory is fresh and they're more inclined to write something meaningful.

### How to Ask: The Warm Approach

Don't just use LinkedIn's generic request tool. Reach out personally first:

**Template:**

> "Hi [Name], I valued working with you on [project/context]. I'm working on strengthening my LinkedIn presence and would love if you'd feel comfortable writing a short recommendation. It would be especially helpful if you could highlight [specific skill, quality, or project impact]. Thank you so much for considering."

**What to avoid:**

- Applying pressure ("I need this for my job search")
- Being vague ("Can you just write me one?")
- Mass-sending the same generic request

## How to Write Strong Recommendations

It's not just about asking—it's about reciprocating. When someone recommends you, offer to write one in return.

### The 4-Part Framework

1. **Context** - How you know the person
2. **Skills and Qualities** - What they demonstrated
3. **Impact** - The difference they made
4. **Closing Endorsement** - Your recommendation

### Example Using the Framework

> "I worked alongside Katrina in the Joy of Coding program where we collaborated on building a Python-based inventory system. **(Context)**
>
> Katrina consistently showed strong problem-solving skills and an eagerness to support teammates by explaining complex logic clearly. **(Skills)**
>
> Her contributions improved our app's efficiency and helped the team stay motivated during crunch times. **(Impact)**
>
> I would highly recommend Katrina for any software development role. She's reliable, collaborative, and technically sharp." **(Endorsement)**

### Weak vs Strong Recommendations

**Weak:**

> "She was nice to work with. A hard worker."

_Problem: Vague, no proof of specific skills_

**Strong:**

> "I collaborated with Hope on a full-stack project where she led the React development. Her ability to debug complex UI issues saved us time and kept our launch on schedule. She communicates clearly, contributes ideas, and is the type of teammate every team wants."

_Why it works: Specific, contextual, persuasive_

### Length Guidelines

Keep it concise: **3-5 sentences** is ideal. Shorter and specific beats long and generic.
