# Feature Specification: Test Coverage Expansion

**Feature Branch**: `052-test-coverage`
**Created**: 2025-12-13
**Status**: In Progress
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Input**: Code review finding - 55 untested files, 54% coverage of lib/services/hooks

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse input from test coverage review
   → Feature: Expand test coverage for critical untested files
2. Extract coverage gaps
   → Critical: 5 payment/auth files with zero tests
   → High: 9 core service files untested
   → Medium: 17 hooks untested
3. Identify affected users
   → Developers: Confidence in refactoring
   → Users: Fewer production bugs
4. Generate Functional Requirements
   → P0: Test critical payment/auth code
   → P1: Test core services
   → P2: Test hooks
5. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on WHAT needs tests and WHY
- Avoid implementation specifics
- Written for quality assurance stakeholders

---

## Problem Statement

The codebase has ~54% test coverage for lib/services/hooks files. Critical payment and authentication code lacks unit tests, creating risk for:

1. **Regressions**: Changes may break untested code paths
2. **Refactoring fear**: Developers avoid improving untested code
3. **Production bugs**: Edge cases not caught before deployment

### Coverage Gap Summary

| Priority | Category       | Untested Files | Risk Level |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Critical | Payments       | 5              | HIGH       |
| Critical | Auth           | 3              | HIGH       |
| High     | Routing/Routes | 3              | MEDIUM     |
| High     | Messaging      | 2              | MEDIUM     |
| High     | Supabase       | 3              | MEDIUM     |
| Medium   | Hooks          | 17             | LOW        |

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary Quality Story

As a developer making changes to critical code, I need comprehensive test coverage so that I can refactor with confidence and catch bugs before they reach production.

### Critical Coverage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Payment Code Coverage

1. **Given** `stripe.ts` handles checkout sessions, **When** tests run, **Then** success and error paths are covered
2. **Given** `paypal.ts` loads SDK and creates orders, **When** tests run, **Then** SDK loading and API calls are mocked and tested
3. **Given** `connection-listener.ts` syncs on reconnect, **When** tests run, **Then** online/offline transitions are tested

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- stripe.ts has > 80% coverage
- paypal.ts has > 80% coverage
- connection-listener.ts has > 80% coverage
- Payment error handling tested

#### Scenario 2: Auth Code Coverage

1. **Given** `retry-utils.ts` implements exponential backoff, **When** tests run, **Then** retry logic and timing are verified
2. **Given** `protected-route.tsx` guards routes, **When** tests run, **Then** redirect behavior is tested
3. **Given** `password-validator.ts` checks strength, **When** tests run, **Then** all validation rules are tested

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- retry-utils.ts has > 90% coverage (pure logic)
- protected-route.tsx has > 80% coverage
- password-validator.ts has > 90% coverage (pure logic)

#### Scenario 3: Core Service Coverage

1. **Given** `osrm-service.ts` calculates routes, **When** tests run, **Then** API calls and parsing are tested
2. **Given** `route-service.ts` manages CRUD, **When** tests run, **Then** create/read/update/delete are tested
3. **Given** `group-service.ts` handles group messaging, **When** tests run, **Then** group operations are tested

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Routing services have > 70% coverage
- External APIs are mocked
- Error handling paths tested

#### Scenario 4: Context Coverage

1. **Given** `AuthContext.tsx` manages auth state, **When** tests run, **Then** sign-in/sign-out/session refresh are tested
2. **Given** `AccessibilityContext.tsx` manages a11y settings, **When** tests run, **Then** setting changes are tested

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AuthContext has > 80% coverage
- State transitions tested
- Error scenarios tested

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-15

**Q1: Test scope for files with existing tests**

Some files already have contract/integration tests:

- stripe.ts → tests/contract/stripe-webhook.test.ts
- paypal.ts → tests/contract/paypal-webhook.test.ts
- protected-route.tsx → tests/integration/auth/protected-routes.test.ts
- database.ts → tests/integration/messaging/database-setup.test.ts
- group-service.ts → tests/unit/services/messaging/group-service.test.ts
- password-validator.ts → tests/unit/auth/password-validator.test.ts

**Decision**: Skip files with existing tests. Focus on 9 truly untested files:

1. src/lib/auth/retry-utils.ts
2. src/lib/payments/connection-listener.ts
3. src/lib/routing/osrm-service.ts
4. src/lib/routes/route-service.ts
5. src/lib/routes/route-export.ts
6. src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
7. src/lib/supabase/client.ts
8. src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts
9. src/contexts/AccessibilityContext.tsx

**Rationale**: More efficient to focus on gaps rather than duplicate existing coverage.

**Q2: Hook testing scope**

Found 16 hooks without tests (not 17 as originally estimated):

1. useCodeBlockPreferences
2. useCompanies
3. useConnections
4. useGroupMembers
5. useIdleTimeout
6. useKeyboardShortcuts
7. useMetroAreas
8. useOfflineStatus
9. usePaymentButton
10. usePaymentConsent
11. usePaymentRealtime
12. useReadReceipts
13. useRoutes
14. useTileProviders
15. useUnreadCount
16. useUserProfile

**Decision**: Include all 16 hooks in test coverage expansion.

**Total scope**: 9 core files + 16 hooks = 25 test files to create.
